# The Things Network MQTT Workshop at EclipseCon France 2016

We are very happy you have joined the MQTT workshop at EclipseCon France 2016 and we are happy to provide you with some awesome Internet of Things tools.

_There are a limited amount of LoRaWAN Arduinos available for you to play around with!_

![The Things Network](https://thethingsnetwork.org/static/ttn/media/The%20Things%20Uitlijning.svg)

The Things Network is offering you a LoRaWAN enabled Arduino and a LoRaWAN network you can make use of.

With these tools you can make any fancy connected application. This page tells you how to obtain the devices and how to get started.

1. Get yourself familiar with The Things Network and itâ€™s potential
    1. [Our home page](http://www.thethingsnetwork.org)
    2. [Wiki](http://staging.thethingsnetwork.org/wiki/Home)
    3. [Forum](http://forum.thethingsnetwork.org)
    4. [Slack](http://slack.thethingsnetwork.org)
    5. [Kickstarter to find out more about our products](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/419277966/the-things-network)
2. Get your Arduino, a light sensor and cable
3. Get the required files from our [Dropbox folder](http://goo.gl/xxZVBZ)
4. Follow [The Things Uno MQTT Workshop](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/examples/tree/workshop/eclipsecon-2016/workshops/TheThingsUno) and see your data in TTN's [dashboard](http://staging.thethingsnetwork.org/applications)
5. Use Eclipse Paho to access the data from your Java code. Use JavaFX to visualize it: [https://github.com/kartben/ttn_paho_workshop](https://github.com/kartben/ttn_paho_workshop)
6. Use Socket.io to access the data in the browser: [example](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/examples/tree/master/socketio).
7. Create a group about your project on our community page here: [https://thethingsnetwork.org/labs/](https://thethingsnetwork.org/labs/)
8. Inspire the community about what you did and how they can replicate by telling them all about it on your groups page.
